# Introduction

This is a guide to the Magic system in GUTS+.

Magic in GUTS+ depends entirely on the concept of [Essence]({{< relref "rules/grimoire_essence.md" >}}). Every living creature is able to utilize their Essence, but it requires a great amount of focus and control to use it. So long as you have an ability that can harness their Essence, you can manipulate it to do a variety of interesting things.
