Your character is your avatar in the game world, and it's also what makes playing the game fun and interesting! When you create your character, it's important to try to build them based on how the character would actually be within the world... you'll see what I mean.

First, get your [Character Sheet](./files/GUTS+_Character-Sheet.pdf) so you can fill it out with your character information.

# Biography

To create your character, first you need a backstory, a personality, and an appearance. It's often fun to model your character after yourself, but you can do whatever you'd like that fits within the specified game world.

### Backstory

The backstory can be either simple or in-depth, though in-depth stories are often the most fun to play because they can help you know how your character would act in any given situation. Did something tragic happen in their past, or did life come easy for them? Were they bullied when they were young, or were they the bully? There are lots of different angles you could approach this from, and this can always be expanded as necessary later.

### Personality

Once you have a backstory in place, it's often easy to decide what kind of personality your character would have as a result of the backstory. Did their tragic backstory make them pessimistic or hopeful for a better future? Did them being bullied influence their sense of justice or tear down their perception of their worth? Don't overthink it too much, just try to be true to what you think your character would be like.

### Appearance

Finally, your character's appearance is probably the least consequential beyond their size. Be as detailed as you want, but at least choose their height, weight, and body type. Smaller character's will be able to squeeze into tighter spaces but won't be able to see over tall walls, while larger characters will be able to stand their ground more easily but not be able to hide very well.
