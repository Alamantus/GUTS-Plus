This book contains examples of different possible types of [NPCs]({{< relref "definition/non-playable-character.md" >}}) you might encounter on your quest with some example stats and equipment, but is by no means a full collection of every possible creature or character that can exist within a GUTS+ game. The creatures contained within are intended to be either a starting point for reference on how to create their own characters or an easy grab bag for the GM to utilize to make their lives easier, but players or the GM can branch off from these base examples however they desire.
