#### Appearance

A slimy blob that can range in size anywhere from 1/2 to 2 square meters and can be just about any color of the rainbow.

#### Background

Slimes are created from magical fallout that results in lost or disconnected essence congealing around a fluid of some kind.

#### Personality

Slimes are semi-sentient and spend most of their time sitting around until another living creature approaches it. At the opportune time, they will attempt to jump at and surround their target, at which point, they will begin to kill the host and intercept its essence, allowing itself to grow larger. Material left over from the assimilation remains inside of the slime until the congealed material composing the slime can deccompose it.
