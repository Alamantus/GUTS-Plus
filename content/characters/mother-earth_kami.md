#### Appearance

Female, 18 years old, east Asian. Has chin-length, straight, black hair, narrow, dark eyes,
a small, pointed nose, and full lips on an round, somewhat flat face with a pointed chin.
She is about 5′ 4″ and weighs 120 lbs. She walks confidently and gracefully.

#### Background

Kami is the daughter of wealthy businesswomen who are co-owners and CEOs of the megacorporation
that has been behind the growth of Startere. Though she has not always had the full attention
of her parents, Kami has always managed to find things to do. She found a group of kids who got
her into running and climbing, which gradually led her to parkour. While there’s not much to run
and climb on in Startere, she’s made do with what is around. She is frequently complained about
and reported to the police, but her quick wit and sharp tongue always gets her out of trouble.

#### Personality

Kami is quiet, but very sharp. She can talk her way out of most situations, and she can escape
the ones she can’t. She spends a lot of her time stretching and practicing flips and rolls so
she can always be ready to run if she needs to. She acts like she doesn’t care if people think
she’s cool, but she absolutely does care. It’s not like she’s desperate, though, because she
really is just so cool.
