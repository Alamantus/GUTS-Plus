This book contains examples of different possible types of items, but is by no means a full collection of every possible item that can exist within a GUTS+ game. The items contained within are intended to be a guideline for how items can generally be used or how clothing might be perceived by [NPCs]({{< relref "definition/non-playable-character.md" >}}), but players or the GM can branch off from these base examples however they desire.
