type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Improvisation is an important skill to have because it not only lets you better utilize your outline, but also allows you to quickly react to whatever your players do in the game. Being able to take a cue from the player and launch a reasonable response will create many interesting and memorable scenarios.
