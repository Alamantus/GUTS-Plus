#### Appearance

Male, 19 years old, caucasian. Has chin-length, curly black hair, round, dark, close-set
eyes, a small, pointed nose that curves up, and thin, perpetually chapped lips on an perfectly
round face. He is about 5′ 5″ and weighs 145 lbs, and he walks in a half-lumbering,
half-slithering way. Rarely wears anything other than graphic tees, sweat pants, and tennis shoes.

#### Background

Gus has been interested in computers his whole life, and has worked on many unfinished
projects. He has collaborated with countless people online, building parts of games and websites,
none of which stuck around long enough to be recognized or make an impact. His parents kicked him
out of the house at age 16 because they didn’t want to care for him anymore, and he has lived in
his uncle’s house since then. Gus rarely sees his uncle, who is a world-traveling archaeologist,
but he doesn’t mind because he gets pretty good internet service and doesn’t have to pay to live
there.

#### Personality

Gus is perhaps more confident than he should be, though he doesn’t mean anything by it. He’s not
trying to be a jerk, he just never learned that the way he talks makes him sound like one. Gus is
fairly self-sufficient, but mostly because he forgets to take care of himself sometimes. He’ll
either end up eating snacks and junk food all day while browsing and socializing on his computer
or completely forget to eat while working on one of his many ongoing projects.
