#### Appearance

Female, 16 years old, Israeli. Has shoulder-length, light brown hair, large, hazel eyes, a
large, round nose, and thin lips on an almost pear-shaped face, a tall, gangly frame, and
an unsure gait. About 5′ 9″ and somewhere around 130 lbs. The very image of a library nerd girl.

#### Background

Nanette grew up very sheltered. Always homeschooled, she has not had much contact with people
outside of her family, but at the age of 16, she feels that she has missed out on life and
wants to befriend people outside of her comfort zone and expand her tiny world. Beyond her
homeschooling, she has spent a lot of time at the library reading and learning about all sorts
of different subjects, though she doesn’t have any real practical application for the things
she’s learned.

#### Personality

Shy and socially stunted, yet eager. Nanette doesn’t know very much about the “real world”,
but she wants to learn. She gets uncomfortable quickly when things are not how she is used to
them and has a strong sense of “how things should be,” even if she’ll never come out and say it.
