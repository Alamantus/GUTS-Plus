      header: What is the GUTS+ System?
      text: |
        The GUTS+ System is a role-playing game system in the spirit of Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder,
        but simplified to focus more on collaborative storytelling and free-form play.

        Rather than having set skills, GUTS+ focuses on individual stats giving your character the ability
        to do things, and if they don't have a specific stat, their success at performing tasks is dependent
        upon their base stats: **G**umption, **U**tility, **T**hought, and **S**lyness

      header: What is this website?
      text: |
        This website is a hub of all the information about the GUTS+ System, and is also an excuse to post
        example campaigns using the GUTS+ System. Because the GUTS+ System is still in development, it also
        contains news and development notes about the process for anyone who might be interested.

        The campaign examples will be posted as serial stories with links to the characters' sheets and
        inventories in every post, so be sure to check back to see what happens!
