        <p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
A crowd converges on the old town hall, where the mayor has called a meeting to discuss the strange happenings in the sky for the past few weeks. There is no more sitting room, but all of the windows and doors have been opened, and a speaker system has been set up on the stage where the mayor will be speaking. After a bit of time, the mayor, a very small man named Fred Devonshire with a pristine, periwinkle suit and a perfectly waxed, white moustache, climbs onto a stool to be seen at the podium at the front of the town hall.</p>

<p>He clears his throat a few times before his voice booms out of the sound system, &ldquo;Citizens of Startere! As you all know and have made me doubly aware, there have been strange, colorful lights and loud noises like something out of a sci-fi movie plaguing our night skies for some time. Last night, I was fed up with not knowing what was happening, and at the first sign of the lights and sounds, I ran outside and fired my skeet-shooter shotgun in the general direction of the light as it flew over town. To my surprise, I believe I actually hit whatever it was, because it promptly stopped with the light show and shortly after, a large explosion was heard in the desert to the east of town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woke half the town up with yer dang shotgun!&rdquo; someone shouts, and the crowd starts murmuring in agreement. Mayor Devonshire bangs a gavel on his podium and shouts for order into the microphone, which elicits a screech of feedback and silences the crowd.</p>

<p>He clears his throat again, and resumes, &ldquo;I have worked with the sheriff to make sure that a team can be put together to go investigate whatever it was, if there is anyone who would like to go. Those who would like to help, please visit the police department after this meeting! We will get to the bottom of this!&rdquo; Mayor Devonshire pulls a glass of water from out of nowhere, takes a drink, and clears his throat yet again before continuing, &ldquo;Now about the new mall project—&rdquo; and the crowd explodes with every possible opinion about the mall.</p>

<p><strong>Kami:</strong><br />
Kami is bored, running on rooftops until she sees the crowd. Sensing activity, she hops onto the town hall roof.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
If you&rsquo;re gonna do that, you&rsquo;ll have to roll, uh… Parkour check, I think.</p>

<p><strong>Kami:</strong><br />
… That&rsquo;s a 6! So yeah, I hop on the roof and kinda hang off the side to look into one of the open windows. I see one of my moms and wave.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
She waves back. So what do you do?</p>

<p><strong>Kami:</strong><br />
After the mayor&rsquo;s speech, I decide that helping investigate the light thing might be fun, so I run and jump off the town hall to head over to the police department.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
Alright, cool! Who&rsquo;s next?</p>

<p><strong>Nanette:</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ll go. So, Nanette was on her way to the library for a meet-the-author of a book about making friends that she had read recently when she came across the overflowing town hall. She notices a small figure standing on the roof as she walks up, but doesn&rsquo;t think much of it as she hears the speakers boom with the mayor&rsquo;s voice. She listens to the speech, but when the mayor moves on from the lights situation, she loses interest and continues walking on to the library.</p>

<p><strong>Kami:</strong><br />
Haha ok, so how about as Kami jumps off the building, she runs into Nanette?</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
Haha, I mean, you could, but Nanette and maybe you will definitely get a minor injury. What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Nanette:</strong><br />
Haa, I&rsquo;d rather not start off with an injury, thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Kami:</strong><br />
Ok ok, fine, so Kami almost runs into Nanette after coming up out of a roll. &ldquo;Whoa, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t see you there! Are you going to the police to help with the thing, too? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; I thrust my hand out for a handshake.</p>

<p><strong>Nanette:</strong><br />
Nanette shrinks back from this confident-looking girl, muttering, &ldquo;No, no, I mean, uhh&rdquo; she hesitantly holds her hand out to shake Kami&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nanette. You&rsquo;re going to investigate?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Kami:</strong><br />
&ldquo;Pleasure, Nanette! I&rsquo;m Kami. Yeah, it sounds cool to see what the flying machine was. Maybe something cool will finally happen here. I can only run on so many roofs in a day before I get bored again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Nanette:</strong><br />
Ok, so Nanette is so desperate to make friends that this feels like a huge breakthrough to her, so she&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Uhh, I mean, yeah, maybe it would be…interesting. If you&rsquo;re going, I guess I&rsquo;ll go too, sure!&rdquo; And then she walks with Kami, trying to keep up.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
Alright, perfect. So what&rsquo;s Gus doing this whole time?</p>

<p><strong>Gus:</strong><br />
Uhh, so Gus has been at home, of course, when he saw a post on one of his forums about a spaceship or something crashing in Startere and that there was a town hall meeting, so he packed up his stuff and headed over to see what they were going to do about it and see if he could come look at the ship. By the time he gets to the town hall, they&rsquo;re not talking about the ship or anything like that, just a stupid mall plan, and it&rsquo;s jumbled chaos.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m imagining that not everyone is super involved in this, and some people are just milling around, right?</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
Yeah, for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Gus:</strong><br />
So yeah, Gus goes and tries to ask one of those people about the space ship and if they had talked about it at all yet.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
So the guy you ask is in like this business suit, not super nice or perfectly fitted, but still what Gus would probably consider &ldquo;fancy&rdquo;, and he&rsquo;s got a briefcase, like he was on his way to work in one of the new buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Gus:</strong><br />
For sure, Gus never dresses up, so just about anything is &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; to him. Haha.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
He just says, &ldquo;Yeah, the mayor says he shot something down last night, hence the gunshots and the explosion. My house is pretty close to where the explosion happened, so I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep.&rdquo; And he just kinda grumbles in frustration at that.</p>

<p><strong>Gus:</strong><br />
&ldquo;Oh, ok, so what&rsquo;s happening? Is there someone going to investigate or something? I missed the speech or whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
&ldquo;Huh? Oh yeah, I think he said if you want to help investigate, go to the police department. Don&rsquo;t know if anyone&rsquo;s actually gonna go, because that&rsquo;s just the police&rsquo;s job. Stupid to ask, honestly.&rdquo; And he kinda just wanders off, presumably heading to work.</p>

<p><strong>Gus:</strong><br />
Alrighty, well Gus is interested, and while he doesn&rsquo;t really want to help or anything, he heads over to the police station to see if he can catch whatever group might be going and follow along behind or something like that. He just wants to see the thing, maybe take some pictures or something.</p>

<p><strong>GM:</strong><br />
Ok, perfect! So everyone is heading over to the police department right now. It&rsquo;s pretty close to the town hall, so it doesn&rsquo;t take long, and you all get there at roughly the same time. Or rather, Gus sees Nanette and Kami walk in the door, and Gus…</p>

<p><strong>Gus:</strong><br />
Yeah, Gus doesn&rsquo;t go in, he just hangs out, maybe looks in the window.</p>
