      <description>Startere was a sleepy, “all-American” town situated in the middle of Nowhere. For years, there were no paved roads into or out of the town, and there was just desert all around–temperate desert, but a wasteland all the same. In recent years, however, people wanting to escape the city life have come and developed suburbs along the outskirts of town, charmed by the quaint little town.
Along the main road, there’s the old general store, mostly stocked with local woodwork from tables and chairs to toys though it sometimes has some factory-made things when a rare shipment comes in; there’s the farm stalls once a week where everyone trades the fruits (and vegetables and eggs and other farm things) of their labor; and a bunch of other useful things like the tailor, a diner, and the big, elaborate Town Hall building.</description>
