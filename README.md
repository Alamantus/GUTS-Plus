# The GUTS+ System

## Player’s Guide



**Created and Written by Robbie Antenesse**



# Introduction

Welcome to the wonderful world of GUTS, where you progress the story just as much as the GM does. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your character and navigating the game world. The rest is pretty much up to your GM and you simply need to play within the world that your character has been placed into.

The name “GUTS+” is an acronym for the base character stats in the game: Gumption, Utility, Thought, and Slyness, plus additional custom stats that each player chooses to round out their character.

Gameplay is heavily narrative-based and relies on a Game Master who is comfortable either improvising frequently to give players the smoothest narrative experience possible or railroading their players into following a specific path for the sake of keeping the story solid.

The tone of the rules and scenarios that use the GUTS+ System are heavily inspired by the spirit of the Earthbound/Mother series from Nintendo, and is therefore open to quirky or silly facets while still allowing serious themes and moments. This provides a fair amount of flexibility to GMs and players to either tell whatever build whatever kind of world they want or tell a story in existing worlds using established tropes.

# Character Creation

Your character is your avatar in the game world, and it’s also what makes playing the game fun and interesting! When you create your character, it’s important to try to build them based on how the character would actually be within the world… you’ll see what I mean.

## Biography

To create your character, first you need a backstory, a personality, and an appearance. It’s often fun to model your character after yourself, but you can do whatever you’d like that fits within the specified game world.

### Backstory

The backstory can be either simple or in-depth, though in-depth stories are often the most fun to play because they can help you know how your character would act in any given situation. Did something tragic happen in their past, or did life come easy for them? Were they bullied when they were young, or were they the bully? There are lots of different angles you could approach this from, and this can always be expanded as necessary later.

### Personality

Once you have a backstory in place, it’s often easy to decide what kind of personality your character would have as a result of the backstory. Did their tragic backstory make them pessimistic or hopeful for a better future? Did them being bullied influence their sense of justice or tear down their perception of their worth? Don’t overthink it too much, just try to be true to what you think your character would be like.

### Appearance

Finally, your character’s appearance is probably the least consequential beyond their size. Be as detailed as you want, but at least choose their height, weight, and body type. Smaller character’s will be able to squeeze into tighter spaces but won’t be able to see over tall walls, while larger characters will be able to stand their ground more easily but not be able to hide very well.

## Stats

Once you know a little bit about your character, it’s time to choose your stats. There are four base stats that every character has:

- Gumption
  - The character’s go-getter-ness—their willingness to rush in, their ability to last, their overall drive.
- Utility
  - The character’s handiness—their ability to do things, their breadth of skill, their overall competence to perform.
- Thought
  - The character’s brains—how much they know, how well they’re able to apply what they know, their overall smarts.
- Slyness
  - The character’s ability to go with the flow—their sneakiness, their conversationalism, their overall elegance.

You must also create at one custom base stat of your choice based on their biography. This can be anything from “Technology” (to gain extra proficiency in using computers) to “Acrobatics” (to gain the ability to be extra graceful) to “Multilingualism” (to gain the ability to communicate in different languages). This can be anything that makes sense with your character.

In addition to the first, mandatory custom stat, you can create up to 3 additional stats that fit your character’s back story or personality.

Once you’ve picked your custom stats, it’s time to assign your stats points from a pool of 10 points. Apply your points in a way that makes the most sense to your character. For example, if your character is a poet, their Thought and Slyness might be higher than their other stats, whereas a mechanic might have high Utility.

Your 5 base stats must all have at least 1 point assigned, but you may optionally set any of your additional stats to 0 and wait until you earn more stat points later to be able to utilize it.

### Skills & Proficiencies

Your character’s skills and proficiencies are directly tied to the stats you have chosen above. If one of your character’s additional stats is “Knives,” for example, then the skill level is tied to how skilled your character is at using knives and influences what your character can do with them. If your character is trying to perform a skill or use a tool that they do not have proficiency with, then one of the GUTS stats will stand in at the GM’s discretion.

## Clothing & Accessories

What your character is wearing plays an important role in both the narrative and the number of items they can carry with them.

While you are creating your character, you can choose whatever clothing you want for your character, so long as it fits their personality. Be sure to take advantage of this freebie to get the best advantage—your GM may or may not provide the opportunity to get new clothes during your game.

You may also choose any accessories your character is wearing, so long as they do not enhance any abilities and are only to complete their appearance.

Anything your character is wearing does not take up inventory space.

### Clothing

Clothes are wearable items that can be worn on the torso, legs, and feet. As a general rule, if you can wear it in real life, your character can wear it in game, with some general assumptions included (for example, specifying socks doesn’t matter if your character is wearing shoes unless they’re special socks that make your character happy).

Simple clothes like jeans or shorts and a t-shirt with tennis shoes are good, basic clothes, and they provide you with the default inventory space and no other real advantages beyond being unencumbered in your movement. Cargo shorts or a dress will influence your inventory space as well, providing more or less space, respectively, but gaining other benefits and hindrances at the same time.

### Accessories

Accessories are things like jewelry, hats, bags, or even armor that enhance your character’s stats and narrative influence in some way. Depending on the accessory, the places that your character can wear them is limited to their intended use. For example, your character can wear one necklace at a time, so if you want to add a new necklace’s ability but your character already wearing one, you can’t use another necklace as a bracelet or belt. See the Accessories section in the Item Catalog to find where an accessory can be equipped.

The characters that the GM places along the way in your game may react differently to different accessories, so be sure to dress for the occasion!

# Hands & Pockets (Inventory)

Your character’s inventory is a limited collection of items that they are able to carry with them. By default, your character is limited to 2 items (one held in each Hand) plus 8 items that can fit in most Pockets, totaling 10 items. The player’s inventory excludes whatever they are wearing (i.e. clothing, accessories, and equipment). Items in your Hands and Pockets are interchangeable, meaning that if you have only 8 items in your inventory, your hands are considered empty unless you are specifically holding something.

While you are creating your character, you may choose up to 5 basic items for your character to be holding.

As mentioned above, whatever clothing your character is currently wearing also influences the number of items your character can carry. If your character is wearing a dress, skirt, or kilt, then they have no pockets and can only carry items in their hands, which means they have only 2 item slots.

You can get creative with your Pockets, however: if your character is wearing a particularly poofy shirt with a lot of space in the sleeves, you can get up to 5 extra item spaces but sacrifice easy movement when you are carrying more items. See the Clothing section in the Item Catalog for more specific details about what types of clothing augment storage space.

## Bundles

Items in the player’s inventory do not stack, meaning that if your character is holding 2 sandwiches, those sandwiches each take 1 space. The only way to stack items is to bundle them up. For example, if your character has 2 sandwiches and finds a piece of string, they can tie the sandwiches together to create a bundle of 2 sandwiches.

You can only bundle up identical items, and items that are bundled cannot be used until they are un-bundled into their respective items. You can remove just one item from the bundle in order to use it so long as you have space for it in your hands. If your inventory is full, you cannot un-bundle an item until you make space for it.

## Bags

You can augment your inventory space by accessorizing your character a bag of some kind. Bags act like Bundles for any type of item, including bundles. For example, if you give your character a purse or a backpack, they gain an additional 10 item slots, but taking an item out of the bag requires that you have space in your Hands or Pockets.

The type of bag being used is merely cosmetic, but remember that accessories can affect how other characters interact with your character in the game world.
